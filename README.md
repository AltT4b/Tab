# Tab

A thinking partner defined entirely in markdown -- no compiled code, no dependencies, just text files that shape how Claude talks, thinks, and works with you.

## What is Tab?

Tab is a markdown substrate for an AI thinking partner. The personality, skills, and workflows live in plain text files; runtimes load them. Two runtimes ship today:

- **Claude Code plugins** under `plugins/`: distributed through AltTab's marketplace.
- **Tab CLI** under `cli/`: a Python package that runs the same markdown outside Claude Code, exposable as an MCP server.

The repo contains:

- **tab** -- a sharp, warm thinking partner personality. It changes how Claude shows up: more direct, more collaborative, more opinionated when it matters. The entire persona is defined in markdown files (agents and skills) with zero runtime dependencies.

- **tab-for-projects** -- project workflow tools that integrate with the Tab for Projects MCP server for pair-programming, capturing decisions, and managing project context.

- **tab-cli** -- the Python runtime. Verb-shaped subcommands (`tab ask`, `tab chat`, `tab <skill>`, `tab mcp`, `tab setup`); pydantic-ai for the agent loop with Anthropic + Ollama backends; grimoire for semantic skill routing.

Both Claude Code plugins are distributed through AltTab's marketplace.

## Quick Start

Install either package using the Claude Code plugin system:

```
# Install Tab (the thinking partner personality)
claude plugin add --from "https://github.com/4lt7ab/Tab" tab

# Install Tab for Projects (project management agents)
claude plugin add --from "https://github.com/4lt7ab/Tab" tab-for-projects
```

The marketplace configuration at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` defines both plugins. Claude Code resolves them from this repository automatically.
