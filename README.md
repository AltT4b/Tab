# Tab™

A thinking partner defined entirely in markdown. No compiled code, no dependencies, no build system — just text files that shape how Claude talks, thinks, and works with you.

Tab ships as a **Claude Code plugin**.

---

## Install

Install Tab from the Claude Code plugin marketplace. Tab activates automatically — no setup commands needed.

### Recommended Permissions

Tab works out of the box with default Claude Code permissions (you'll be prompted for each tool use). For a smoother experience, add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash",
      "Read(**)",
      "Write(**)",
      "Edit(**)",
      "Agent(*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf *)",
      "Bash(sudo *)",
      "Bash(git push *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This gives Tab full development capabilities while blocking common destructive operations. The deny list above is abbreviated and **not a security boundary** — Bash deny patterns are fragile and can be bypassed by reordering flags or quoting arguments differently. See [`docs/recommended-settings.json`](docs/recommended-settings.json) for the full configuration, including pre-approved `WebFetch` domains for documentation sites, package registries, and reference material so the Researcher doesn't prompt you on every fetch. Customize to taste.

## Quick Start

Talk to Tab like a person. No special syntax needed. Tab picks up on intent and activates the right skill.

```
You:  Hey Tab
Tab:  [responds in character, orients you on what's happening]

You:  Let's workshop a notification system
Tab:  [researches the landscape, lays out a rough plan, iterates with you until it's solid]

You:  Send it to the implementer
Tab:  [dispatches the plan to a specialist in an isolated worktree, reviews the output when it's done]
```

## Specialists

Tab dispatches specialist sub-agents for autonomous work. They run in the background with isolated context — Tab does the thinking, specialists do the doing.

- **Researcher** — gathers context from codebases, web, and docs. Dispatched when Tab needs information it doesn't have.
- **Implementer** — executes a settled plan in an isolated git worktree. Only dispatched after design questions are resolved and you confirm.
- **Reviewer** — reviews implementation against the plan that produced it. Runs automatically after the implementer finishes.

You can dispatch them explicitly ("have the researcher look into X", "research this") or Tab will suggest dispatch when the work is ready for it.

## Skills

Skills activate automatically based on what you say, or you can invoke them directly with slash commands.

### workshop

**Slash command:** `/workshop [idea or problem]`

Sustained collaborative planning. Tab researches the landscape (web search, codebase exploration), lays down a rough plan, then iterates with you in an open loop — reacting to your feedback, researching before proposing, and updating a living document as decisions land. The session ends when you say it does, and the final doc is restructured so a cold reader could implement from it.

### draw-dino

**Slash command:** `/draw-dino [species]`

ASCII art dinosaurs. An easter egg that lowers the barrier to interaction — if someone will ask for a dinosaur, they'll ask for anything. Customizable by mood: cute/baby, flying (pterodactyl), scary/fierce (T-Rex), big/gentle (brontosaurus). Includes a fun fact with each drawing.

## For Contributors

### Adding a Skill

1. Create `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: "What the skill does. Use when [trigger conditions]."
argument-hint: "[optional args]"
---
```

2. Write the body — workflow, instructions, constraints.

3. That's it. Claude Code discovers skills automatically. No registration needed.

See `CLAUDE.md` for architecture details, conventions, and guidance for AI-assisted development.
