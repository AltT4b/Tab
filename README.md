# Tab

A thinking partner defined entirely in markdown -- no compiled code, no dependencies, just text files that shape how Claude talks, thinks, and works with you.

## What is Tab?

Tab is a Claude Code plugin repository containing two packages:

- **tab** -- a sharp, warm thinking partner personality. It changes how Claude shows up: more direct, more collaborative, more opinionated when it matters. The entire persona is defined in markdown files (agents and skills) with zero runtime dependencies.

- **tab-for-projects** -- project workflow tracking through one agent (developer) and three skills (design, develop, retro) that integrate with the Tab for Projects MCP server for capturing decisions, tracking tasks, and managing project context.

Both packages are distributed as Claude Code plugins through AltTab's marketplace.

## Quick Start

Install either package using the Claude Code plugin system:

```
# Install Tab (the thinking partner personality)
claude plugin add --from "https://github.com/4lt7ab/Tab" tab

# Install Tab for Projects (project management agents)
claude plugin add --from "https://github.com/4lt7ab/Tab" tab-for-projects
```

The marketplace configuration at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` defines both plugins. Claude Code resolves them from this repository automatically.
