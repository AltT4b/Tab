"""Tests for :mod:`tab_cli.skills` — the personality-skill runner.

The runner is the shared machinery behind the four personality-skill
ports (``draw-dino``, ``listen``, ``teach``, ``think``). Each port is a
thin wrapper; almost every interesting behaviour lives here:

- ``read_skill_body`` opens the actual ``plugins/tab/skills/<name>/SKILL.md``
  and returns its body sans frontmatter. The acceptance criterion for
  the draw-dino port pins exactly this — behaviour is driven by the
  markdown file, not by a Python-side copy of the prompt.
- ``build_skill_system_prompt`` composes Tab's persona prompt with the
  skill body so personality dials remain live during a skill turn.
- ``run_skill`` runs one synchronous turn against a model. We stub the
  agent so the test never touches a provider; the assertion is that the
  user input round-trips through ``run_sync`` and the result reaches
  the caller.
