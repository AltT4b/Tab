"""Tests for the ``tab ask`` one-shot subcommand.

The wiring under test is small but load-bearing: the CLI argument and
``--model`` option must round-trip through ``compile_tab_agent``, the
agent's ``run_sync`` output must reach stdout, and any exception from
either step must collapse to a readable stderr line plus a non-zero
exit code (no traceback dump — this command is the shell-out / CI
entry point and tracebacks make it hostile to scripting).

We mock ``compile_tab_agent`` so the test never reaches a real model
provider. The stub records each call so the prompt round-trip
assertion is precise — the test fails if either the positional prompt
argument or the ``--model`` option is dropped on the floor.
