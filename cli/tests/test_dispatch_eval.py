"""Calibration regression test for the dispatch fixture.

The contract this test pins:

* Run every labeled query in ``cli/tests/fixtures/dispatch_eval.json``
  through the gate seeded with the v0 personality skills, classify each
  pair via ``grimoire.calibration.calibrate``, and check the
  Pattern-B-vs-calibration property: no query should land in
  ``WRONG_PASS`` — that's the load-bearing safety property the
  silence-by-default routing relies on.
* Every *non-ambiguous* fires-case (a row whose ``expected`` names a
  skill and whose entry has no ``notes`` annotation) must end in
  ``CORRECT_PASS``. CORRECT_MISS for a fires-case means the right item
  won the top-1 but the bar was too tight; that's a calibration drift
  worth surfacing as a failure.
* The two ambiguous rows (those carrying a ``notes`` field — see
  fixture commentary) get a non-fatal audit-log block printed to stdout
  with their bucket and notes, so reviewers can sanity-check the
  judgement call when calibration changes.

The gate is constructed with a hand-curated *concept embedder*, not
the production Ollama embedder. Reasons:

* No Ollama in the test loop — keeps the suite Postgres-/Ollama-free,
  same constraint the existing ``test_registry`` fakes respect.
* The hashed-bag-of-words used by ``test_registry`` is deliberately
  too crude for fixture-style queries to clear the default 0.55
  threshold (probed: nearly every fires-case lands as CORRECT_MISS
  under it). A bag-of-words can demonstrate routing direction but
  cannot demonstrate calibration; this fixture is specifically about
  calibration.
* The concept embedder uses orthogonal one-hot dimensions per skill,
  driven by trigger phrases pulled directly from the fixture's
  fires-cases. That makes the cosine match deterministic and crisp:
  in-skill queries land at sim=1.0, ambiguous and out-of-skill queries
  land at 0.0 (below the bar). When the fixture changes, the trigger
  set documented here is the place to update — they're a regression
  contract together.

The structure mirrors ``test_registry.py``: same ``_InMemoryRepository``
shape, same ``embedder_from_callable`` seam, same ``Gate`` constructor.
