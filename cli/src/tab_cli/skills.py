"""Generic personality-skill runner.

The first port (``draw-dino``) and the three that follow (``listen``,
``teach``, ``think``) all share the same shape: read
``plugins/tab/skills/<name>/SKILL.md``, take the body as instructions,
run a turn against the configured model, print the result. This module
holds the shared machinery so each port ticket only adds a thin wrapper
(a Typer subcommand, a chat-dispatch line) instead of duplicating the
"open the file, strip the fence, build an agent" plumbing.

Design choices that aren't obvious from the call sites:

- **Persona delta, not replacement.** The skill's system prompt is the
  Tab persona (settings preamble + ``tab.md`` body) plus the skill body
  appended underneath. That keeps personality dials live during a skill
  turn — a 5%-warmth dino is still a Tab dino — and matches what the
  task body calls "a delta on top of the Tab persona prompt."
- **No prompt cache in source.** The body is read off disk on every
  ``run_skill`` / ``compile_skill_agent`` call. Skill prompts change as
  the personality plugin evolves and a stale cached copy would silently
  drift. The cost is one ``read_text`` per invocation, which is a
  rounding error next to the model call.
- **Same plugins-dir resolution as the registry / personality compiler.**
  Default is ``<repo>/plugins`` derived from this file's location. Tests
  pass a tmp dir to exercise loader edges; production code can omit.
