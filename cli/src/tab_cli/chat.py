"""Interactive REPL loop for ``tab chat`` (and bare ``tab``).

A turn is: read a line of user input, classify it, react.

- ``/exit`` / ``/quit`` / EOF (Ctrl-D) end the session cleanly.
- A "set <setting> to NN%" / "be more <adjective>" phrase mutates the
  active :class:`TabSettings`, recompiles the agent, prints a one-line
  acknowledgement, and continues.
- Anything else goes through the grimoire registry: an above-threshold
  hit dispatches the matched skill (Tab persona + SKILL.md body); a
  miss is routed to the agent and the response is streamed back.

The ``listen`` skill is sticky: matching it flips the session into
listen mode, where every subsequent line bypasses grimoire and
settings detection and routes straight to the listen skill agent. The
SKILL.md body keeps Tab silent during the dump and emits the synthesis
when the user signals done. ``/done`` is the explicit exit signal —
the line is forwarded so the skill agent produces the synthesis, then
the session returns to normal chat.

History persists across turns within the session by passing
:meth:`AgentRunResult.all_messages` (or its streamed equivalent) into
the next ``run_stream_sync`` call as ``message_history=``. Recompiling
the agent for a settings change does **not** reset history — the
conversation continues with the new system prompt in effect.

The chat module deliberately holds no provider state of its own; the
agent does. ``--model`` passes through to :func:`compile_tab_agent`,
and recompilation on a settings change re-uses whatever model name was
captured at session start.
