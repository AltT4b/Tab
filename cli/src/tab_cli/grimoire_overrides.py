"""User-level grimoire threshold overrides for the personality-skill registry.

The synthesis on task 01KQ2YXEDJFXCJCFTERK6WFZW9 picked combination
*D + B*: SKILL.md frontmatter holds the author-default, and a CLI
command sets a user override on top of it. This module owns the
override half — the persisted store, the read/write API, and the
"effective threshold + source" computation that ``tab grimoire show``
prints.

The frontmatter half is a separate ticket. Until it lands, every
``SkillRecord`` ships with :data:`tab_cli.registry.DEFAULT_THRESHOLD`
and the ``source`` reported here is ``loader-default`` (or ``override``
when the user has set one). Once the loader learns to read
``grimoire-threshold`` from frontmatter, ``effective_thresholds`` will
naturally start reporting ``frontmatter`` for any record whose
threshold diverges from the loader default — no change required here.

Persistence shape — v0
-----------------------

The synthesis defers the durable shape of user state to the
settings-system design ticket (01KQ2YXEDHVD2YG1DPD9HEVR2S). Until that
lands, this module writes a tiny JSON file at
``~/.tab/grimoire-overrides.json`` (alongside :mod:`tab_cli.config`'s
``~/.tab/config.toml``):

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "version": 1,
     "thresholds": {
       "draw-dino": 0.45,
       "teach": 0.7
     }
   }

When settings-system lands, this store gets folded into the canonical
TOML (likely a ``[grimoire.thresholds]`` section per the synthesis).
The JSON file becomes legacy and a one-shot migration drops it.

TODO(settings-system 01KQ2YXEDHVD2YG1DPD9HEVR2S): replace the
JSON-on-disk path with whatever shape that ticket lands. Until it
lands, mention this debt in any code review that touches the file
location.
