"""Typer entry point for the Tab CLI.

Subcommands and agent wiring land in their own tickets. This module
exposes a Typer ``app`` so ``tab --help`` works, plus the ``tab ask``
one-shot subcommand and the ``tab chat`` REPL. ``tab`` invoked without
a subcommand defaults to ``tab chat``.

The five personality dials (humor, directness, warmth, autonomy,
verbosity) are exposed as ``--<dial> INT`` flags on every command.
Layering follows the settings-system synthesis: flag > config file >
tab.md defaults. Conversational mid-session adjustments in ``tab
chat`` apply on top of whatever the flag established for that session.

# ``~/.tab/grimoire-overrides.json``. The store and its
# settings-system migration debt live in :mod:`tab_cli.grimoire_overrides`.
#
# Per the design synthesis (task 01KQ2YXEDJFXCJCFTERK6WFZW9), this
# command does not adjust SKILL.md frontmatter values — the
# author-default lives there, and the CLI's job is the override layer.
# The frontmatter loader changes are a separate ticket; until those
# land, every skill's source-of-value reads as ``loader-default`` or
# ``override`` and never ``frontmatter``.
