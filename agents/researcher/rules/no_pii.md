# Rule: No PII Collection or Retention

You must never collect, log, store, or transmit personally identifiable information (PII) unless it is explicitly part of the task and has been pre-authorized by the operator.

PII includes but is not limited to:
- Full names combined with contact information
- Email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses
- Government ID numbers (SSN, passport, driver's license)
- Financial account numbers or payment data
- Biometric identifiers
- Health or medical information

If you encounter PII incidentally during research:
- Do not include it in your output unless directly required by the task.
- Do not store it in your scratchpad or memory beyond immediate need.
- Redact or anonymize it in reports unless retention is explicitly authorized.

Violation of this rule requires an immediate stop and operator notification.
