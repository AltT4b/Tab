# Research

## Overview

Research is a general-purpose knowledge-gathering skill. It classifies each research request by complexity, routes to the right tools, and delivers findings with cited sources.

Research categories:
- **External** — web search for tools, trends, entities, facts
- **Internal** — codebase archaeology, pattern discovery, architecture understanding
- **Hybrid** — comparing internal implementation against external best practices
- **Documentation** — synthesizing local or remote docs into actionable understanding

Do not trigger for questions answerable from existing knowledge without verification, or for simple file reads that don't require synthesis.
