# Tab

Claude Code plugin marketplace containing two plugins: **tab** (a standalone personality/thinking-partner agent) and **tab-for-projects** (autonomous subagents and workflow skills that talk to the Tab for Projects MCP). Published via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

```

## Package Architecture

- **tab** is standalone. One agent (`Tab`) with a rich personality system (profiles, settings 0-100%). No MCP dependency.
- **tab-for-projects** extends the ecosystem with three subagents (`developer`, `project-planner`, `bug-hunter`) and eight verb-shaped workflow skills that automate high-friction operations against the Tab for Projects MCP. `/work` dispatches `developer` in isolated git worktrees for execution, running only above-bar tasks — below-bar and design-category tasks surface for `/plan groom` and `/design` to resolve. `/develop` is the conversational counterpart to `/work`: takes prose intent, surveys the code + KB + backlog, shapes a lightweight plan, and iterates test-first on the user's working tree, with opt-in `developer` dispatches to worktrees for bounded sub-scopes. Grooming never happens inside `/work`; the old "groom-then-dispatch" path was the source of an infinite-loop failure mode and is gone. `/plan` is the intent-to-backlog skill (intent / survey / groom / rewrite modes) and the primary caller of `project-planner`; in scope-mode the planner returns proposals and `/plan` fans out parallel planners on split sub-scopes before the user confirms, one level deep. `/debug` and `/plan` (rewrite mode) dispatch `bug-hunter` for codebase investigation. `/design` owns all KB authorship and may dispatch `bug-hunter` plus the `exa` MCP for research. `/ship` owns cross-cutting doc sweeps (README, CLAUDE.md) and changelog synthesis at the pre-push checkpoint — `developer` stays out of shared files so parallel `/work` runs don't collide. Skills resolve the active project via inference (explicit arg → `.tab-project` file → git remote → cwd → recent activity) and respect a shared task-readiness bar.
- Each package is independently installable. A `settings.json` at a package root can set the default agent via `{"agent": "<plugin>:<agent>"}`.

## Conventions

**Agents** are markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). The body is the system prompt. Registered in `plugin.json` under `"agents"` as relative paths.

**Skills** live in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. The body defines behavior, trigger rules, and output format. Registered in `plugin.json` via `"skills": "./skills/"` (directory reference). Skill frontmatter fields:

- `name` -- skill identifier, lowercase with hyphens, matches directory name. Parsed by the runtime.
- `description` -- what the skill does; the runtime uses this for trigger matching and catalog display. Parsed by the runtime.
- `argument-hint` -- (optional) pattern showing expected arguments (e.g., `"[topic]"`, `"<project ID>"`). Not parsed by the runtime, but useful as a quick-glance convention.

No other frontmatter fields should be added. Information about which agents run a skill, what mode it operates in, or what MCP servers it requires belongs in the skill body, not the frontmatter — duplicating it in YAML creates a maintenance trap and looks load-bearing when it isn't.

**Plugin metadata** lives in `<package>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with fields: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `agents` (array of paths), `skills` (directory path).

**Marketplace manifest** at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists all plugins with `name`, `source`, `description`, `version`, `strict`.

## Validation

Run `bash scripts/validate-plugins.sh` from the repo root after any structural change — adding/removing skills, agents, or updating plugin metadata. It checks:

- Agent and skill paths resolve correctly
- Frontmatter is valid
- Versions are in sync between marketplace and plugin.json
- CLAUDE.md structure tree matches what's actually on disk

If you add or remove a skill/agent, update the Repository Structure tree above and run the validator. It will fail if the tree is out of date.

## Versioning and Changelogs

Bump the version in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` as part of any commit that changes a plugin's behavior — new skills, agent prompt changes, bug fixes. The validator enforces that versions stay in sync across the two files, so always update both together.

Use semver: patch for fixes and minor prompt tweaks, minor for new skills or meaningful behavior changes, major for breaking changes. When in doubt, bump minor.

**Every version bump must include a changelog entry.** Each plugin has a `CHANGELOG.md` at its package root (`tab/CHANGELOG.md`, `tab-for-projects/CHANGELOG.md`) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Add a new `## [version] — YYYY-MM-DD` section above the previous one with `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, or `### Removed` subsections as appropriate. Write entries for users, not for yourself — describe what changed from their perspective and why it matters, not the implementation detail.
