# Tab

Personality, workflows, and skills defined in plain markdown — runtimes are interchangeable.

Two runtimes live here:

- **Claude Code plugins** under `plugins/`: **tab** (a standalone personality/thinking-partner agent) and **tab-for-projects** (autonomous subagents and workflow skills that talk to the Tab for Projects MCP). Published via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- **Tab CLI** under `cli/`: a Python package (`tab`) that runs the same markdown substrate outside Claude Code — multi-provider via pydantic-ai, semantic-gated skill routing via grimoire, exposable as an MCP server.

The markdown is the source of truth; the runtimes read it.

```

## Package Architecture

Two Claude Code plugins (`plugins/tab`, `plugins/tab-for-projects`) and one Python runtime (`cli/`). All three sit on the same markdown substrate — `agents/*.md` and `skills/*/SKILL.md` under `plugins/tab/` — so personality and skill changes flow to whichever runtime loads them.

- **tab** (Claude Code plugin) is standalone. One agent (`Tab`) with a rich personality system (profiles, settings 0-100%). No MCP dependency.
- **tab-for-projects** (Claude Code plugin) extends the ecosystem with four subagents (`developer`, `project-planner`, `bug-hunter`, `archaeologist`) and six verb-shaped workflow skills that automate high-friction operations against the Tab for Projects MCP. `archaeologist` is the autonomous design-synthesis path — reads project code and KB, returns a structured design summary, closes design tasks on clean synthesis (picks sane defaults and flags them when real forks surface). `/work` dispatches `developer` in isolated git worktrees for implementation tasks and `archaeologist` on the main thread for design-category tasks — below-bar tasks surface for `/plan groom`, archaeologist-escalated forks surface for `/design`. `/develop` is the conversational counterpart to `/work`: takes prose intent, surveys the code + KB + backlog, shapes a lightweight plan, and iterates test-first on the user's working tree, with opt-in `developer` dispatches to worktrees for bounded sub-scopes. Grooming never happens inside `/work`; the old "groom-then-dispatch" path was the source of an infinite-loop failure mode and is gone. `/plan` is the intent-to-backlog skill and the primary caller of `project-planner`; it handles new work from outcomes, scopes, or replacement targets plus grooming of existing below-bar tasks. `/plan` shapes the dispatch (one planner call, or parallel planners for large scopes — one level deep), confirms it with the user, and hands off a well-formed prompt. The planner writes tasks directly — the confirm gate is upstream, at dispatch time. Replacement-target scopes trigger a research pass (KB reads, optional `bug-hunter` for behavior surveys, optional `exa` for external analogues) before the dispatch is shaped. `/plan` (rewrite mode) dispatches `bug-hunter` for codebase investigation. `/design` owns all KB authorship and dispatches `archaeologist` for code + KB synthesis research plus the `exa` MCP for external analogues; `bug-hunter` stays available for runtime-bug concerns that masquerade as design forks. `/ship` owns cross-cutting doc sweeps (README, CLAUDE.md) at the pre-push checkpoint as a coherent pass: changelog synthesis, version bump, drift review. Skills resolve the active project via inference (explicit arg → `.tab-project` file → git remote → cwd → recent activity) and respect a shared task-readiness bar.
- **tab-cli** (Python package, `cli/`) runs the markdown substrate outside Claude Code. Typer for the verb-shaped CLI surface (`tab ask`, `tab chat`, `tab <skill>`, `tab mcp`, `tab setup`); pydantic-ai for the agent loop and tool dispatch; grimoire for semantic-gate routing of user input against skill descriptions with per-skill thresholds. Two backends: `anthropic:<model>` via pydantic-ai's stock `AnthropicModel`, and `ollama:<model>` via Tab's in-house `OllamaNativeModel` (talks to Ollama's `/api/chat` directly, sidestepping pydantic-ai's stock `OllamaModel` which routes through the `/v1` OpenAI-compat layer). v0 ports the `tab/` plugin's personality skills (`draw-dino`, `listen`, `think`, `teach`); the `tab-for-projects` skills stay Claude-Code-shaped because they're tightly coupled to the MCP and the subagent dispatch primitive. The CLI reads its substrate from `plugins/tab/` so the markdown stays singular. `tab mcp` exposes the CLI as an MCP server for any MCP-aware host (including Claude Code) to call.
- Each Claude Code plugin is independently installable. A `settings.json` at a package root can set the default agent via `{"agent": "<plugin>:<agent>"}`. The CLI installs separately via `uv sync` inside `cli/`.

## Conventions

**Agents** are markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). The body is the system prompt. Registered in `plugin.json` under `"agents"` as relative paths.

**Skills** live in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. The body defines behavior, trigger rules, and output format. Registered in `plugin.json` via `"skills": "./skills/"` (directory reference). Skill frontmatter fields:

- `name` -- skill identifier, lowercase with hyphens, matches directory name. Parsed by the runtime.
- `description` -- what the skill does; the runtime uses this for trigger matching and catalog display. Parsed by the runtime.
- `argument-hint` -- (optional) pattern showing expected arguments (e.g., `"[topic]"`, `"<project ID>"`). Not parsed by the runtime, but useful as a quick-glance convention.

No other frontmatter fields should be added. Information about which agents run a skill, what mode it operates in, or what MCP servers it requires belongs in the skill body, not the frontmatter — duplicating it in YAML creates a maintenance trap and looks load-bearing when it isn't.

**Plugin metadata** lives in `plugins/<package>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with fields: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `agents` (array of paths), `skills` (directory path).

**Marketplace manifest** at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists all plugins with `name`, `source`, `description`, `version`, `strict`.

**CLI package** lives in `cli/` with standard Python conventions: `pyproject.toml`, `src/tab_cli/`, `tests/`. The CLI reads markdown from `plugins/tab/` rather than duplicating it — the substrate stays singular across runtimes. CLI work runs from `cli/` (`uv sync`, `uv run tab`, `uv run pytest`).

## Validation

Run `bash scripts/validate-plugins.sh` from the repo root after any structural change — adding/removing skills, agents, or updating plugin metadata. It checks:

- Agent and skill paths resolve correctly
- Frontmatter is valid
- Versions are in sync between marketplace and plugin.json
- CLAUDE.md structure tree matches what's actually on disk

If you add or remove a skill/agent, update the Repository Structure tree above and run the validator. It will fail if the tree is out of date.

## Versioning

Bump the version in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` as part of any commit that changes a plugin's behavior — new skills, agent prompt changes, bug fixes. The validator enforces that versions stay in sync across the two files, so always update both together.

The CLI versions independently in `cli/pyproject.toml`. It's not in the marketplace, so the validator doesn't touch it.

Use semver: patch for fixes and minor prompt tweaks, minor for new skills or meaningful behavior changes, major for breaking changes. When in doubt, bump minor.

This repo does not maintain a changelog — git history is the source of truth for what changed.

## Commit Messages

Short. Wordplay over summary. The diff already says *what* changed — the subject line is flavor, not a recap.

Riff on the code being committed: a pun, a callback, a phrase that fits. Aim for under ~40 chars. Drop the conventional-commit prefix (`fix:`, `feat:`) unless it's part of the joke.

Recent examples to calibrate against:

- `always be shufflin'`
- `fix: no more changelogs`

If the joke doesn't land in a line, it's too much. A body is fine when context genuinely needs it, but the subject stays terse.
