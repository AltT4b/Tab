# Tab

Claude Code plugin marketplace containing two plugins: **tab** (a standalone personality/thinking-partner agent) and **tab-for-projects** (a developer agent that talks to the Tab for Projects MCP). Published via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## Package Architecture

- **tab** is standalone. One agent (`Tab`) with a rich personality system (profiles, settings 0-100%). No MCP dependency.
- **tab-for-projects** extends the ecosystem with one agent (developer) that interacts with the Tab for Projects MCP for project/task/document CRUD.
- Each package is independently installable. A `settings.json` at a package root can set the default agent via `{"agent": "<plugin>:<agent>"}`.

## Conventions

**Agents** are markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). The body is the system prompt. Registered in `plugin.json` under `"agents"` as relative paths.

**Skills** live in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. The body defines behavior, trigger rules, and output format. Registered in `plugin.json` via `"skills": "./skills/"` (directory reference). Skill frontmatter fields:

- `name` -- skill identifier, lowercase with hyphens, matches directory name. Parsed by the runtime.
- `description` -- what the skill does; the runtime uses this for trigger matching and catalog display. Parsed by the runtime.
- `argument-hint` -- (optional) pattern showing expected arguments (e.g., `"[topic]"`, `"<project ID>"`). Not parsed by the runtime, but useful as a quick-glance convention.

No other frontmatter fields should be added. Information about which agents run a skill, what mode it operates in, or what MCP servers it requires belongs in the skill body, not the frontmatter — duplicating it in YAML creates a maintenance trap and looks load-bearing when it isn't.

**Plugin metadata** lives in `<package>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with fields: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `agents` (array of paths), `skills` (directory path).

**Marketplace manifest** at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists all plugins with `name`, `source`, `description`, `version`, `strict`.
