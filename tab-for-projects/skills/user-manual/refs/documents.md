# Document Reference

## Document Types

Each type serves a distinct purpose. Pick the type that matches what you're capturing.

| Type | When to use | Typical tags |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **ADR** | A single decision with rationale, alternatives, and consequences | `decision`, `architecture` |
| **Design doc** | A significant change needing evaluation — context, goals, design, tradeoffs | `architecture`, `decision` |
| **Architecture overview** | System structure, components, boundaries, how they connect | `architecture`, `reference` |
| **Requirements doc** | What a feature or system must do — functional and non-functional constraints | `reference`, + domain tag |
| **Feature doc** | Why a feature exists, how it works, how to use it | `guide`, + domain tag |
| **Pattern record** | An established codebase pattern with file references and rationale | `conventions`, + domain tag |
| **Convention doc** | Naming, structure, integration, or style conventions | `conventions`, + domain tag |
| **Reference doc** | API contracts, config shapes, lookup tables, enum definitions | `reference`, + domain tag |
| **Troubleshooting guide** | Symptoms, causes, fixes for known problems | `troubleshooting`, + domain tag |

**ADRs vs. design docs:** An ADR captures one decision. A design doc evaluates a broader change that may involve multiple decisions. If the scope is "we chose X over Y," write an ADR. If the scope is "here's how we're restructuring the auth system," write a design doc.

## Create-vs-Update Discipline

The KB should grow in depth, not breadth. Before writing, search for what already exists.

### Before Every Write

1. Call `list_documents({ search: "[topic]" })` to find existing documents on the same topic.
2. Scan titles and summaries. If a document covers this topic, call `get_document` to read it.
3. Decide: update or create.

### When to Update

- A document already covers this topic — add sections, correct stale information, refresh content.
- New information extends or refines what's already documented.
- The existing document is partially wrong — fix the inaccuracies rather than creating a parallel version.

### When to Create

- The topic is genuinely new — no existing document covers it.
- The scope is fundamentally different from any existing document, even if the domain overlaps.

### When Superseding

- Create the new document first.
- Add a note at the top of the new document: "Supersedes: [old doc title] ([old doc ID])."
- Update the old document's summary to note it has been superseded and by what.
- Both documents persist — the old one provides historical context.

### The Bias

**Default to updating.** Creating is the exception. Ten well-maintained documents beat fifty stale ones.

## Tagging Conventions

Tags use a **closed enum**. Only these values are valid:

| Category | Tags |
|----------|------|
| **Domain** | `ui`, `data`, `integration`, `infra`, `domain` |
| **Content type** | `architecture`, `conventions`, `guide`, `reference`, `decision`, `troubleshooting` |
| **Concern** | `security`, `performance`, `testing`, `accessibility` |

### Rules

- **1-3 tags per document.** Pick the most relevant, not all that could apply.
- **Always include one content-type tag.** This is the primary classifier — it tells readers what kind of document this is.
- **Add a domain tag when the document is domain-specific.** An architecture doc about the data layer gets `architecture` + `data`. A general conventions doc gets `conventions` alone.
- **Add a concern tag only when the concern is the focus.** A security ADR gets `decision` + `security`. A feature doc that mentions security in passing does not get `security`.

### Common Combinations

| Document | Tags |
|----------|------|
| ADR about API auth approach | `decision`, `security` |
| Architecture overview of data pipeline | `architecture`, `data` |
| Naming conventions for UI components | `conventions`, `ui` |
| Troubleshooting MCP connection issues | `troubleshooting`, `integration` |
| General coding conventions | `conventions` |
| Performance tuning guide | `guide`, `performance` |

## Document Ownership

The **tech lead is the single owner of all KB document output.** No other agent calls `create_document` or `update_document`. This centralized ownership ensures consistency, prevents duplication, and enables KB health management.

### Tech Lead — Single Document Owner

The tech lead writes all document types:

| Source | Document types | Examples |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **From code investigation** | Pattern records, convention docs, drift corrections, codebase references | "Pattern: MCP tool handler structure", "Conventions: File naming in skills/" |
| **From analysis and decisions** | Design docs, ADRs, architecture overviews, feature docs | "Design: Auth system restructure", "ADR: Event-driven sync over polling" |

The tech lead's bias is toward **updating** over creating. Its primary job is keeping existing documentation accurate and the KB lean (soft cap: 10 documents per project).

### Tech Lead — Owns All Document Types

The tech lead both analyzes systems for design decisions and investigates code for codebase truth. It writes all document types directly:

| Situation | Tech lead does |
|-----------|----------------|
| New design decision needed | Researches, evaluates alternatives, writes the ADR or design doc |
| Architecture overview needed | Analyzes system structure, creates the architecture overview document |
| Codebase drifted from design | Detects drift, updates the document to match reality |
| New convention emerged | Discovers the convention in code, creates convention doc |
| Existing doc is stale | Updates or supersedes the document |

## Passing References

Documents are the interface between advisory agents. The protocol for sharing:

### Write First, Share Second

1. Write or update the document using `create_document` or `update_document`.
2. Attach it to the project using `update_project({ items: [{ id: "[project-id]", attach_documents: ["[doc-id]"] }] })`.
3. Share the document ID with teammates.

### Reference Format

When passing a reference to another agent, include three things:

- **Document ID** — the lookup key.
- **2-3 sentence summary** — what the document contains and why it matters.
- **Implication for the recipient** — what it means for their work.

Example:

> Architecture decision documented in `01ABC123`. Key points: chose event-driven sync over polling for lower latency and simpler error handling. This affects task decomposition because the sync service needs an event bus dependency. Verify the current codebase doesn't already have a polling implementation that needs migration.

### What NOT to Do

- **Never paste document content into messages.** IDs are the interface. The recipient fetches what they need.
- **Never reference a document without its ID.** Titles change; IDs don't.
- **Never share a document ID without context.** A bare ID forces the recipient to fetch and read before knowing if it's relevant.
